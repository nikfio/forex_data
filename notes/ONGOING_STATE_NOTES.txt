        data to local files are dumped by years
        key format for the dotty dict of managed data:
            . organize by year or unify alla available data for the pair? 
                --> download chain of functions call to improve: efficiency and capability of
                    organization by year

        historical data maanagement into consolidation:

                . only plot functionality remains to be tested
                . to be evaluated it is useful to manage multiple timeframes and related data by the same manager instance 


        realtime data management:

                . tried get_quote functions
                . to try function to read window data (daily, weekly, start-end, etc) with ohlc values
                . align data format as used in historical manager to have common data organization
