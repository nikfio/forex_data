NOTES - SORTED BY GENERATION DATE - EXPLAINING HOW IT IS GOING, WHAT IS COMPLETED AND THE SUGGESTED IMMEDIATE NEXT WORK/THING TO SOLVE

    - 20220219

        A) completed download of N years, dumped to file on a year basis
        B) working on loading data from local database folder
        C) executed initial commit

        TODOs

        1) test .resample method in histdatalib
        2) complete function that searches on local folder if specified data is available
            . YES: read load data to object
            . NO : exit with no action taken ----> data needs to be downloaded

        3) Start real-time data management: get, update local database, plotting

    - 20220220

        Added dotty_dict package:
            a dotty() instance for local data (= _local_db) will have all the details related to available data 
            on current local database folder

    - 20220301

        Need to empower data management with dotty dictionaries

    - 20220309

        data to local files are dumped by years
        key format for the dotty dict of managed data:
            . organize by year or unify alla available data for the pair? 
                --> download chain of functions call to improve: efficiency and capability of
                    organization by year

        historical data maanagement into consolidation:

                . only plot functionality remains to be tested
                . to be evaluated it is useful to manage multiple timeframes and related data by the same manager instance 


        realtime data management:

                . tried get_quote functions
                . to try function to read window data (daily, weekly, start-end, etc) with ohlc values
                . align data format as used in historical manager to have common data organization

        realtime data management:

            ALPHA_VANTAGE:

                . daily, weekly, etc.. get functions means timeframe parameters --> too scarse
                . only intradaily functions is reasonable (minimal timeframe = 1min) but time span is very limited

            POLYGON:

                . API description seems to give better data - low timeframe and longer time span
                . still to effectively try out

        realtime data management:
        
            confirmed polygo-io provider combined with python client is what I was lookig for,
            data req with minimal timeframe of 1 minute and time interval can be set with date specifications
            over the trailing 2 years 
            
            meanwhile, alpha_vantage is still useful if the start date param is within the previous midnight
            - within the current day: FX_INTRADAY request type
            
            decided to avoid completely pandas datareader API
            now focusing on alpha_vantage api by romel torres and official python client for polygon-io

        historical data management:
        
            noted on histdata.com significative - maybe new - features:
            
                . all tickers data are up to current month, starting year-month not fixed, depends on ticker
                  although max start year is 2002/2003
                . data files are distributed also with 1-minute bar (ohlc aggregates) data, 
                  tick data files are still available
                  tick data means interval  < 1min, but it is generic meaning a fixed frequence value
                  is not granted
                  
    - 20220813
    
        tested functions to get daily data with interval options
        now interval options parsing must be generalized in common functions to be used 
        generically across data manager
        
    - 20220828
    
        realtime manager: testing with generic get_date_interval function
        historical manager: progress on supporting a list of timeframes rather than a single one
        
    - 20221013
    
        realtime manager: working on parsing data _parse_time_window_data()
                          received from polygon-io get_aggs()
                          and alpha-vantage get_currency_exchange_intraday()
                          called in get_time_window_data()
                          need to comply with project data templates
                          
        historical manager: no substantial progress
        
        package: introduce poetry for package management
        
        upon finishing testing get_time_window_data()
        next step is dynamic support for multiple timeframes in both
        historicaldata_manager and realtimedata_manager
        ---> composing the database_manager

        hundred percent focus on simultaneous support of multiple timeframes
        in historical data manager and realtime data manager

        improving and proceeding with multiple dataframes
        pandas.read_csv of TICK files is significatively long
        switched to dask dataframe 
        is it worthy to have all database in db manager of dask dataframe type?
